    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage!</h1>
     <p>This is my first attempt at creating a complete HTML webpage. I'm excited to learn web development and share my journey with you.</p>
     <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This page includes all the required elements: multiple paragraphs, different heading levels, and a clickable image. I'm following the ALX project requirements to make sure I learn proper HTML structure.</p>
    <h3>Why Web Development?</h3>
     <p>Web development is a fascinating field that combines creativity with technical skills. It allows you to build things that people all over the world can use and interact with.</p>
    
     <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>After mastering HTML, I plan to learn CSS to style my pages, and then JavaScript to add interactivity. The journey to becoming a full-stack developer begins with this simple webpage!</p>
